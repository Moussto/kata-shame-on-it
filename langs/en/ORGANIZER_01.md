# :information_source: Organization of a session

## :books: Set up (10 minutes)

Form groups of 2 or 3 developers.

The organizer will distributes code to each attendees group may be one or more to
analyze ([snippets](/snippets/)). The idea is that each group has snippet
different.

Idea: _Print the snippet on sheets A5 or A6._

## :mag_right: Running the kata (10-15 minutes by snippet)

Once the snippet are distributed, each group can begin their analysis. The analysis must be
on the "cleanliness" of the code. The concept of cleanliness is rather relative to everyone, so we
have to agree between participants in the same group on things that are wrong.

Once the dirt has been identified, it is necessary to propose 1, 2 or 3 different alternatives of
which at least better than the original snippet.

## :mega: Pooling (5 minutes by snippet)

After a few minutes the group must present the result of their work to all participants.
The report must contain:
- the analysis of what is wrong;
- the proposed alternatives.

After restitution of each snippet, we can take a few minutes to discuss solutions proposed.
