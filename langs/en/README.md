# Kata Shame-on-it

## :family: Introduction

I learned how to use the rear brakes on my downhill bike, and not to use front break in some 
conditions to avoid catapulting myself. I learned not to annoy a person
who holds a cat in his arms. I learned to position myself in a foldable bed so that not to fold
myself in it. I even learned not to eat too slow.

You would say "Thank goodness you learned all that!", And you're right. And I had the
chance to grew up in a big family to let my brothers and sisters do all these
mistakes, and to learn from them.

I like to tell myself that it is also one of the ways to progress in the art of development.
Instead of relying on my colleagues, I prefer learning from their mistakes. In this Kata
we will go though a summary of what you can found in any project.

The general idea is to leave here lots of good ideas for better tomorrow.

**We will look at another developer's code and try to learn from it.**

Keep in mind that none of the developer knows how to code by birth.
He started coding with his previous experience and off course he'll get better and better by time,
for sure.

In short, we can criticize a code while not hurting the feeling of writer.

## :memo: Help for the most beginners

To detect a code that deserves to be reworked there are some questions that can
guide research:
- Is there duplicate code? Or a duplicate code structure?
- Is there a piece of code that needs to be re-read several time to be understood?
- Does touching a piece of code seem risky?
- Is there a piece of code that annoys me?

This is not an exhaustive list, there are many more questions to ask. However
I think they will help you out the first pitfalls.
